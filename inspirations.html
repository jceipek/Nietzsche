                        although after some playing around and lots of hitting the “reload data” button, it seems that
                         the time listed is the time when the train leaves) the next station. Trains and their times are 
                        color coded (eg a blue train leaves a station at the time listed in blue), but it took me a while 
                        to figure that out (I like this idea, as it makes it easier to see how late missing one train will 
                        make you, although it’s not implemented very well). Also took a while for me to realize I had to hit 
                        the phone's menu button in order to have the option of switching to a different line. Doesn’t 
                        automatically update times after a train has passed, which is a problem. Remembers which line you were 
                        last looking at, which is nice. (From Laurence)
