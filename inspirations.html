              <p>At heart, all transportation software is information software.</p>

              <p>
                It tells us how to get from where we are to where we want to go.
                Unfortunately, many existing applications in this field are designed as manipulation software
                -- they often force us to specify the type of route and when we want to leave or arrive.
                When we use them again, they forget everything about how they were used before and force us to enter even
                <em>more</em> data.

                primary inspirations; it promotes a design approach structured around the way we
                actually use data to inform our decisions.

                    although after some playing around and lots of hitting the “reload data” button, it seems that
                     the time listed is the time when the train leaves) the next station. Trains and their times are
                    color coded (eg a blue train leaves a station at the time listed in blue), but it took me a while
                    to figure that out (I like this idea, as it makes it easier to see how late missing one train will
                    make you, although it’s not implemented very well). Also took a while for me to realize I had to hit
                    the phone's menu button in order to have the option of switching to a different line. Doesn’t
                    automatically update times after a train has passed, which is a problem. Remembers which line you were
                    last looking at, which is nice.

          <h2 id='embark'>Embark: BOS for iOS</h2>

                    Embark has a variety of features and interactions that make it far easier and more enjoyable to use than similar applications.
                    The MBTA system map  is not a static image, but an interactive display. When a station is clicked, it displays a schedule of trains arriving soon.
                    When searching for places, Embark can suggests stations with similar names, but can also use a Google search as an alternative.
                    This does not work as well as the Google Maps application,  but is still infinitely better than other applications which only allow you to use station names.
                    The results page is a short list of options that display information important in making a decision (total duration, walking distance, etc.).
                    Other applications do this too, but the information overflows to the step-by-step directions once you have picked a route.
                    Embark collapses each leg of the journey into an easy to view, single step. It can be expanded if clicked on, but this is
                    not the default mode—perfect for the average user.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    There are numerous other features that make Embark stand out—integrated walking directions,
                    searching through your list of contacts, texting your route to a friend’s cell phone—but overall it stands out because
                    of its visual simplicity, restraint in displaying information, and intuitive layout of tasks.

          <h2 id='madrid'>Metro Madrid App</h2>
              <div class="row">
                <div class="span4"><img src="assets/images/inspirations-gallery/metro-madrid.jpg" alt="metro madrid app"/></div>

                    Really useful for Metro users. However, if you are an infrequent Metro user, it doesn’t look so useful for you.
                    If you open this app, you will see a menu (home) in which you have to choose what you want to do.
                    No matter what it shows, if you are an infrequent Metro user and want to go somewhere else, I’m sure you would choose journeys.
                    There you can choose between current location,or even drop a pin in the map in order to select your start point.
                    When you get all your information done, you will choose between two options: fewer stops or fewer transfers.
                    And finally you will get a brief summary of your journey, which even doesn’t inform you about the time that it’s going to take you.
                    Although you can choose a street to start your journey, the app won’t give you any direction to go from that street to the nearest station,
                    so you would have to figure out the way. Selecting any of the other options, you can find more uselessness.
                    For example, if you choose map you will get the image of the map but you would have to find where you are
                    (remember that you are an infrequently Metro user) and even worse you would have to find out where you are going. Tough task!
