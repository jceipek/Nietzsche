        <h2><a name="t-times"></a>MBTA T Times</h2>

            <div class="span5">Graphical representation of all the T stops on a particular subway line (except the green line) 
                        showing where each train is at this moment and when it will (leave? arrive at? app is unclear, 
                        although after some playing around and lots of hitting the “reload data” button, it seems that
                         the time listed is the time when the train leaves) the next station. Trains and their times are 
                        color coded (eg a blue train leaves a station at the time listed in blue), but it took me a while 
                        to figure that out (I like this idea, as it makes it easier to see how late missing one train will 
                        make you, although it’s not implemented very well). Also took a while for me to realize I had to hit 
                        the phone's menu button in order to have the option of switching to a different line. Doesn’t 
                        automatically update times after a train has passed, which is a problem. Remembers which line you were 
                        last looking at, which is nice. (From Laurence)</div>

        <h2><a name="embark"></a>Embark: BOS for iOS</h2>
	    <div class="row">
	    <div class="span4"><img src="embark-screen-2.png" alt="embark 1"/></div>
            <div class="span5"><p>Embark has a variety of features and interactions that make it far easier and more enjoyable to use than similar applications. The MBTA system map  is not a static image, but an interactive display. When a station is clicked, it displays a schedule of trains arriving soon. When searching for places, Embark can suggests stations with similar names, but can also use a Google search as an alternative. This does not work as well as the Google Maps application,  but is still infinitely better than other applications which only allow you to use station names. The results page is a short list of options that display information important in making a decision (total duration, walking distance, etc.). Other applications do this too, but the information overflows to the step-by-step directions once you have picked a route. Embark collapses each leg of the journey into an easy to view, single step. It can be expanded if clicked on, but this is not the default mode—perfect for the average user.</p>

<p>There are numerous other features that make Embark stand out—integrated walking directions, searching through your list of contacts, texting your route to a friend’s cell phone—but overall it stands out because of its visual simplicity, restraint in displaying information, and intuitive layout of tasks.</p></div>

	<h2><a name="madrid"></a>Metro Madrid App</h2>
	    <div class="row">
	    <div class="span4"><img src="metro-madrid.jpg" alt="metro madrid app"/></div>
	    <div class="span5">Really useful for Metro users. However, if you are an infrequent Metro user, it doesn’t look so useful for you. If you open this app, you will see a menu (home) in which you have to choose what you want to do. No matter what it shows, if you are an infrequent Metro user and want to go somewhere else, I’m sure you would choose journeys. There you can choose between current location,or even drop a pin in the map in order to select your start point. When you get all your information done, you will choose between two options: fewer stops or fewer transfers. And finally you will get a brief summary of your journey, which even doesn’t inform you about the time that it’s going to take you. Although you can choose a street to start your journey, the app won’t give you any direction to go from that street to the nearest station, so you would have to figure out the way. Selecting any of the other options, you can find more uselessness. For example, if you choose map you will get the image of the map but you would have to find where you are (remember that you are an infrequently Metro user) and even worse you would have to find out where you are going. Tough task! (From Pati)</div>
