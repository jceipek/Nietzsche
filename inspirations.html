                         the time listed is the time when the train leaves) the next station. Trains and their times are 
                        color coded (eg a blue train leaves a station at the time listed in blue), but it took me a while 
                        to figure that out (I like this idea, as it makes it easier to see how late missing one train will 
                        make you, although it’s not implemented very well). Also took a while for me to realize I had to hit 
                        the phone's menu button in order to have the option of switching to a different line. Doesn’t 
                        automatically update times after a train has passed, which is a problem. Remembers which line you were 
                        last looking at, which is nice. (From Laurence)</p>

        <h2><a name="embark"></a>Embark: BOS for iOS</h2>
            <p><strong>Useful Interaction:</strong> After installing the application you are presented with this screen. Unlike all other applications I saw, Embark made their own version of the MBTA map that had interactive stations, i.e. you can click on a station and have the option of picking it as a destination, a start point for a new trip, or seeing which trains will be passing through soon. You can only view individual stations on a city map, not the entire system. Using a city map is how most apps present route information, and whilst I can see how it might sometimes be useful to see where stations are on a city map (for example: “let’s wander around Boston Common—how many T stations are near there?”), Embark’s search function would be sufficient for most situations.
One of the neatest features is a small icon in the bottom left that automatically finds the nearest station to you. This search is extremely quick and shows you the station both on the system map and in the smaller city map.</p>
	    <p><strong>Smarter Search:</strong> When searching, Embark can suggests stations with similar names, but can also use a Google search as an alternative. This does not work as well as the Google Maps application, but is still infinitely better than other applications which only allow you to use station names. Some of these applications don’t even have a list of stations or suggestion names—you just have to know what they are. Embark makes it much easier to search for destinations use the same natural terms you would in real life, e.g. addresses, landmarks, etc.<br/>
Embark also remembers your last search. Presumably this is so you can easily flip the start and end points when you want to return home. This is not a strictly unique feature, but many other applications had the option to save routes or stations as favorites. With that said, those features would probably be more appropriate for regular users of the T, whereas we are looking to work with infrequent users.</p>
	    <p><strong>Just The Right Amount Of Information:</strong> Once you have entered where you want to go, Embark gives you a list of suggestions. There is no way of filtering the search, e.g. “don’t use commuter rail”, which to me seems like a fairly important feature for someone who doesn’t know the system well. If I was in an entirely new transit system and only need to make one journey, I would be willing to take a longer route if I only needed to use the T, rather than the T, the commuter rail, and a bus. I believe that the flight-search service Hipmunk calls this “agony”.<br/>
Despite this, Embark’s presentation of options is much better than other applications. Some applications require that you specify when you plan to leave, what systems you wish to use (you have to pick “subway” or “bus” and are not given the option for combining the two). Their search results often just give a list of times or train numbers, which imply that there is information useful to you, but Embark gives factors that might be relevant in making a decision to you up front. It tells you when you would leave, when it thinks you would arrive, and how long it should take. Notice that that the duration is larger than the arrival time, since I might need to be somewhere by a certain time, but I also care about how much time I’m going to spend sitting in a box. Embark also tells you how much walking will be required, since you are able to input start and end points that are not just T stops.<br/>
An initial reaction I had is confusion as to why multiple options are provided when the only difference between them is the start time. Perhaps the routes I experimented with only had one conceivable route to get there, which leads to the major flaw of this application (from a data standpoint): no inclusion of bus service!</p>
            <p><strong>Getting Directions:</strong> Many other applications use this vertical flow of step-by-step directions, but Embark’s interface is significantly cleaner, smoother, and more practical. One application included half-a-dozen “later times” that connecting trains or busses will arrive at, whereas Embark merely tells you how long each segment takes, how long it expects connections to last, and the estimated time of each major node. The “time to make a connection” is really interesting because it does not say “wait until Train #12345 N arrives at 7:05 pm”, it simply tells you how long you’ll be waiting.<br/>
One feature I did not see on any other application is the option to Tweet/text your itinerary. Presumably this is so, if a user is meeting someone, they can let the other person know of when they expect to arrive and where they will be. This seems like a potentially better way of coordinating a pick-up, since Embark can not only give a predicted arrival time to the picker-upper, but can also provide them real-time data about delays. In other words, this app has functionality to users who are not directly using the T, but are still affected by it.</p>
	    <p><strong>Less Is More:</strong> I also like how rather than displaying ever single stop you pass by, Embark says how many stops you will go past before you should get off. If you want to see the names of the stations you pass, you can click on the little arrow, which will expand the display and show you all stations. The other app I used that had this vertical flow did not have any collapsibility in its design, forcing the user to scroll for what seems like an eternity before seeing information related to your destination.<br/>
Similarly, walking directions are suppressed until asked for. Embark does not integrate with the native Maps application in iOS to provide walking directions, but at least shows you where you are and where you need to be. For someone who is brand new to the area, this might be an extremely important absence.</p>
	    <p><strong>Flaws:</strong> The list is significantly shorter than those of other apps, but this app still has room for improvement. I have already mentioned the need for walking directions not just walking points and the ability to filter which transit systems I’d like to use (although this is probably related to the app currently only offering train data). Additional suggestions:<br/>
                <ul>
		    <li>Do users <em>really</em> need to know the exact time they will arrive at each stop during their journey?</li>
		    <li>Sometimes the <em>shortest</em> journey is not always the <em>best</em> journey. For example, the shortest journey might require a connection with a very narrow layover. What happens if the user misses the connection? Will a 10 minute delay translate into being 10 minutes late or 4 hours late? Picking options based on frequency of available trains and being able to visualize that data <em>could</em> be very over-loading to new users, but using Embark’s principle of “show only when asked for” seems like a possible solution.
