<h2>Learning Process</h2>
In order to develop a better understanding of the users we are trying to help, our team began a process of observation and interviewing.

Individually we were able to examine the current offerings of mobile applications. There proved to be a wide variety of styles and approaches to helping people utilize public transportation (see Design Inspirations) and this helped us start to think about the sorts of information that people need to plan and execute a journey. Since we used public transportation to get into Boston for user interviews, we were also able to observe individuals looking at maps, consulting phones, calling friends, or asking for assistance. These interactions were very brief, but still helped our initial research.

Before conducting interviews, we used our observations to help craft a list of question to ask users. Some of these questions included:
How frequently and under what circumstances do our users use public transportation?
How do they plan new routes? What information do they need? What information do they currently lack?
What are their frustrations or difficulties with using public transportation?
What are their strategies for dealing with those difficulties? 
What are their feelings about public transportation?

It was more convenient to conduct interviews over the phone with users we knew personally. This helped us refine our questions and start to sort our notes into values, complaints, insights, and personal information. We supplemented these initial conversations by going to the Harvard Square train station on a Saturday, allowing us to find vacationers, families visiting Boston colleges, and other distinctly infrequent T users.

In total we interviewed 15 individuals and amassed ~400 sticky notes worth of information.

<h2>Learning Synthesis</h2>
After collecting all information, we used an affinity-mapping style exercise to further sort our notes into values, needs, desires, habits, personal information, and insights. Patterns began to emerge quite quickly. Some of the more interesting lessons learned include:
Some users feel powerless and want more control. They feel uncomfortable having to rely on others to get them from place to place on time.
Some users are resigned to the inconveniences of public transit and don’t see a way to solve it. For them, spending time exhaustively planning a route is a waste of time since the plan will not line up with reality.
A single user can have very different priorities for traveling, depending on circumstance. Factors like weather and mood can dramatically influence the decisions a user makes. Going to work and leaving work can have very different goals that prompt the user to take very different routes.

Certain observations or complaints were common across almost all user interviews:
When getting from A to B, “A” & “B” are rarely public transportation hubs. There is still some amount of travel required between a train station/bus stop and a user’s final destination.
A schedule is meaningless if there is a high degree of variability within the system. “Power users” prefer to use live data because it is more “accurate” than the printed schedule.
Trains are better than buses because they arrive/depart much more frequently than buses.
