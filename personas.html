<p>
Peter: needs to be at his office by 9 AM.
Peter checks his phone to see if there are any services delays on the line he usually takes and to double check the morning T schedule.
Gets to his local station ~15 minutes early to give himself some margin for error.
Gets on first train, keeping close to the door so he can make a quick exit
Exits train before getting stuck in the crowd
Works his way through morning commuters to get to his connecting train
Gets on and checks his watch to make sure he is on time
Arrives to work early, the model of professionalism 
Henry & Elise: need to get to sight-seeing attractions in Boston.
They go to the hotel concierge and ask which T stations are near the attractions
They ask the concierge to write the station names down so they don’t forget
At the T station closest to the hotel,
purchase a day ticket
Henry & Elise consult the system map and figure out which trains they need to take, making special note of any connections
Get on the next train that comes
Consult the system map inside the train to make sure they know when to get off
Exit the train and wait for any connections
Repeat 5-7.

Lilah: needs to figure out how to get herself and her friends to a restaurant in Boston on a Friday night out.
Lilah uses Google Maps to find the busses or trains that go near the restaurant
Since a bus stop is closest to the restaurant, Lilah uses NextBus on her phone to figure out when the next bus stops at their dormitory
The bus is full since it’s a Friday night, so Lilah and her friends have to wait until the next one.
Lilah and her friends are meeting some other friends at the restaurant, so she texts them to let them know they will be late.
Eventually they can get on the bus that takes them to the restaurant.

Samantha: needs to take her children, Alex and David, to the New England Aquarium to see their father.

Sam uses Google Maps to find the station closest to the aquarium
She then uses the MBTA route planner to look at which trains she must take to get there
She wants to minimize time, walking distance, and number of connections, but the planner makes her pick one. She picks “minimize connections”
Uses the MBTA planner to figure out when they should leave home, but Sam leaves ~15 minutes early to give herself time to deal with delays.
Sam waits for the bus - sure enough, it’s running late.
Sam has to entertain her children while they stand outside waiting for the bus
Sam has to transfer from a bus to the Orange line. Getting a stroller down the steps is a pain, but easier than waiting for an attendant to let her use the elevator.
Sam needs to figure out which train to get on while keeping track of her children
People are very friendly and help her on to the T
Exit the T.
