	<h4>Competitor Systems: MBTA-Suggested Apps</h4>
	    <ul>
	        <li><a href="http://www.whereisthet.com/">Where is the T</a>: A web app that tells you how long until the next train arrives at your stop. Only available on some lines, no capability for routes or connection planning.</li>

	        <li>TransitTimes+</li>
		<li><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/my-stop-boston/id435308399?mt=8">My Stop Boston</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/openmbta-for-ipad/id395963566?mt=8">OpenMBTA for iPad</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/embark-boston-t-mbta-by-embark/id494522038?mt=8">Embark</a>: 
			Pick anywhere as a start and end point. Will display three separate trips that are happening "soon" 
			that you can save for a later time. Listing includes walking distance and estimated total time. 
			Has a linear route for stops, but you can collapse the train lines (i.e., don't show every 
			individual station you pass). Gives an estimate for how long each connection will take. 
			Walking directions can be opened in Google Maps with pins on start and end points. You 
			can tweet or SMS your travel plan. There are alerts, but they aren't connected to any 
			route planning. Push notifications are available, but only for "commute hours". It's 
			very intuitive and much more pleasant to use than any other apps we found. And it's free. (From Brett)</li>
		<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.aharm.mbta&hl=en">T Times</a>: 
			Graphical representation of all the T stops on a particular subway line, 
			showing where each train is at this moment and when it will (leave? arrive at? app is unclear, 
			although after some playing around and lots of hitting the “reload data” button, it seems that
			 the time listed is the time when the train leaves) the next station. Trains and their times are 
			color coded (eg a blue train leaves a station at the time listed in blue), but it took me a while 
			to figure that out (I like this idea, as it makes it easier to see how late missing one train will 
			make you, although it’s not implemented very well). Also took a while for me to realize I had to hit 
			the phone's menu button in order to have the option of switching to a different line. Doesn’t 
			automatically update times after a train has passed, which is a problem. Remembers which line you were 
			last looking at, which is nice. (From Laurence)</li>

		<li>Metro Madrid App: 
			An application for iPhone which is really useful for Metro users. However, if you are an infrequent 
			Metro user, it doesn’t look so useful for you. If you open this app, you will see the menu (home) 
			in which you have to choose what you want to do (Stations, Journeys, Map or Info). No matter what 
			you choose, if you are an infrequent Metro user and want to go somewhere else, I’m sure you would 
			choose journeys. There you can choose between current location, near station, station from where 
			you want to start and drop a pin in the map in order to select your start point. Afterwards you 
			have to select your destination (same way options as shown before). When you get all this information 
			done, you will choose between two options: fewer stops or fewer transfers. And finally you will get 
			a brief summary of your journey, which even doesn’t inform you about the time that it’s going to 
			take you. Moreover, if something happens while you are doing the expected journey, no notifications 
			will inform you so it’s really annoying because you would be stuck. Also, although you can choose 
			a street to start your journey, the app won’t give you any direction to go from that street to the 
			nearest station, so you would have to figure out the way. Selecting any of the other options, you 
			can find more uselessness. For example, if you choose map you will the image of the map but you 
			would have to find where you are (remember that you are an infrequently Metro user) and even worse 
			you would have to find out where you are going. Tough task! Maybe if app developers had chosen to 
			insert an interactive map, it would be useful for users. So, Metro Madrid App is a good app for 
			people who know Metro or at least they know some of the stations and their working because its way 
			of showing information is neat and you can see what you want easily. (From Pati)</li>
