__humanizing MBTA transit__

------------

What?
-----

Getting around Boston using public transportation can be difficult, especially for new or inexperienced users

+ Routes are confusing
+ Arriving on time is a challenge
+ Bus and train schedules are not connected to reality

------------

There are several "trip planner" applications that try and help, but they have their share of problems

+ They assume the schedule is always accurate
+ They "reset" after every use and never learn your habits
+ Finding the information you need takes time and effort
+ Nietzsche MBTA aims to solve those problems and create an application that helps new and inexperienced of public transportation master the MBTA with confidence and ease.

Public transportation shouldnâ€™t be hard.
